# PRESSURE
## A Strategic Board Game of Force Mechanics

### Components
- 5×5 grid board
- 6 black tokens and 6 white tokens (two-sided with neutral gray backs)
- 12 small markers to indicate inactive tokens (optional)

### Setup
1. Place the board between both players
2. Each player takes their 6 tokens showing their color side
3. Players arrange their tokens in the following positions:

   **Black tokens:**
   - a3, a4, b3, b5, c4, c5

   **White tokens:**
   - c1, c2, d1, d3, e2, e3

   ```
       a   b   c   d   e
     ┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐

     ├───┼───┼───┼───┼───┤
   1 │   │   │ ○ │ ○ │   │
     └───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘
   ```
4. White moves first

## Core Rules

### 1. Basic Movement
- On your turn, you must move ONE of your tokens
- Move directly into an adjacent space (orthogonally: up, down, left, or right)
- You cannot move diagonally
- You cannot move inactive tokens (tokens with a red marker)
- If your destination space is empty, simply move your token there
- If your destination space is occupied, you are attempting to "push" and must follow the pushing rules

### 2. Pushing
- Pushing occurs when you move your token into an occupied space
- You can push both your tokens and opponent tokens
- You can only push if there is an empty space at the end of the connected line
- Your moving token is pushing the whole connected line.
- Any opponent tokens that are pushed become inactive for their next turn
- Your own tokens never become inactive from your pushing

**Push Example** 
```
Before: [W][W][B][W][ ]
After:  [W][ ][W][B][W]
```
The middle White token can push connected tokens to the right, because there is a space after the connected tokens. The pushed Black token becomes inactive.

### 5. Inactivity
- Enemy tokens that are pushed become inactive for their owner's next turn
- Inactive tokens are marked with a small red marker
- Inactive tokens cannot be moved but can still be pushed by either player
- At the end of each player's turn, all their inactive tokens become active again

### 6. Capture
- When a token becomes completely surrounded on all four orthogonal sides (by any combination of tokens or board edges), it is immediately flipped to its captured blue side
- Captured (blue) tokens cannot be moved directly by either player
- Captured tokens can be pushed as part of a connected line
- Captured tokens still can be used to surround enemy tokens
- Once captured, tokens remain captured for the rest of the game

**Capture Example:**
```
   [B]
[W][W][B]
   [W]
```
The White token in the center is surrounded on all four sides and is immediately captured (turned blue).

**Board Edge Capture Example:**
```
[E][B]
[E][W][B]   
[E][W]

[E] represents board edge
```
The White token is surrounded on all four sides (three by tokens and one by the board edge) and is captured (turned blue).

## Victory Conditions
The game ends immediately when either:
1. A player captures all enemy tokens
2. A player has no legal moves on their turn
3. A player surrenders

## Clarifications

### Connected Line of Tokens
- Tokens are "connected" when they are adjacent to each other in a straight line
- There can be no gaps in a connected line
- Example of a connected line: [W][W][B]
- Example of tokens that are NOT a connected line: [W][ ][B]
